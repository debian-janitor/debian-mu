* TODO (fixes, ideas, etc.)

** Future stuff

*** mu

  - handling of signed / encrypted messages
  - maybe use gstringchunk in mu-msg-cache
  - put threading information in the database, and enable getting the complete
     threads when searching
  - refactor fill_database function in test cases
  - handling of command line options / help

*** mu4e

  - identities (see Jacek's 'mu4e: From field in replies' mail)
  - mu4e~view-wrap-lines (use visual-line-mode? see Jacek's mu4e~view-wrap-lines
    mail)
  - actions for /all/ headers, actions for /all/ attachment
  - custom header fields in headers-view, message-view
    - 'human' dates
  - guile integration
    - statistics
  - check if we can speed up mu4e-proc parsing by using search rather than
    regexp search
  - show maildirs as a tree, not a list in speed bar
  - review emacs menus
  - re-factor / separate window/buffer management
    - enable keeping message view buffers around
    - better naming for draft/view buffers
  - header updating interferes with marks (when updating for 'mark as read',
    when reading a marked message)
  - tooltip for flags field
  - set/unset flag editing command
  - handling of database upgrades
  - restore point after rerunning a search
  - opening urls is too eager
  - make the mu4e-bookmarks format similar to the other ones
  - refresh current query after update?

** Done

  - make next/prev header respect prefix argument (Jacek's patch)
  - make search results a stack (well, multiple stacks)
  - optionally keep cc with user's email
  - enable setting/unsetting 'Flagged' on messages
  - allow narrowing of search results
  - interactive split-view control (Jacek)
  - view images inline
  - *FIX* slow maildirs when there are many
  - *FIX* ignore unrecognized maildir flag letters
  - *FIX*: reply-to does not make it to the frontend
  - *FIX* wrong buffer deleted after sending (see '(non mu) buffer is killed')
  - rich text composing (with org-mode)
  - let message-mode deal with burying/killing compose buffers
  - *FIX* add runtime check for imagemagick
  - *FIX* no error note if target message already exists (when moving)
  - sorting + show / hide threads
  - *FIX* having multiple header views visible
  - *FIX* fix for strings where len (g_utf8_strdown (str)) > len (str)
  - make sure marks correspond to the *current* message in message view (see
    https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/26)
  - *FIX* don't remove unknown message flags when moving
  - make guile/gtk/webkit dependency optional
  - improve fringe marks (see https://github.com/djcb/mu/issues/21)
  - mark message, decide what to do with them later (i.e.. 'deferred marking')
  - custom predicate functions for marking
  - make mu4e buffer killing less aggressive (i.e.., DWIM)
  - about mu4e
  - hide some headers when composing
  - fix sorting subjects with ':' (but not 'Re:' or 'Fwd:')
  - strip signature from original when replying
  - make refresh after changing sort, threads the default
  - contact completion (see Jacek's 'mu4e: using' mail)
  - *FIX* emacs23 mailto: handling
  - *FIX* message interference
  - *FIX* emacs23.2+ auto-completion
