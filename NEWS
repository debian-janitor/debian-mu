   - There's now 'mu extract' for getting information about MIME-parts
     (attachments) and extracting them
   - Queries are now internally converted to lowercase; this solves some of the
     false-negative issues
   - All mu sub-commands now have their own man-page
   - 'mu find' now takes a --summary-len=<n> argument to print a summary of
     up-to-n lines of the message
   - Same for 'mu view'; the summary replaces the full body
   - Setting the mu home dir now goes with -m, --muhome
   - --log-stderr, --reindex, --rebuild, --autoupgrade, --nocleanup, --mode,
     --linksdir, --clearlinks lost their single char version

     is needed

     by upgraded (--autoupgrade). Also, the log file is automatically cleaned
     when it gets too big (unless you use --nocleanup)
   - Search for a certain Maildir using the maildir:,m: search prefixes. For
     example, you can find all messages located in ~/Maildir/foo/bar/cur/msg
