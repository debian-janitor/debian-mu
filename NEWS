* 2008-10-30: mu 0.4
** new features:
   - aggregate data (statistics) for queries
   - better handling of non-UTF8 messages
   - search for absence of a flag; e.g. F:^a matches msgs without attachments
   - updated documentation
   - extended mu-msginfo to get more information (fields) from messages
   - more unit tests
   - experimental: some gtk widgets
  
** known issues
   - none at this time

** limitations
   - mu-index will ignore html messages without a plain-text part for xapian
     indexing
   - search for user-agent, mailing-list was removed

* 2008-09-25: mu 0.3
** new features:
   - search expression bookmarks
   - support quoting in search expressions
   - relative dates (1w, 2d, 3y etc.)
   - when searching for a certain date [day-beginning - day-end] is used as the
     interval
   - add search for message priority (using p:L|N|H )
   - add search for message content properties (attachment, signed, encrypted)
   - substantial performance improvements on ext3 filesystems (inode sorting),
     tunable using command line / configuration file
   - updated documentation

** limitations

* 2008-09-10: mu 0.2
** new features:
   - full content-search (using Xapian), see mu-find(1) for examples
   - optimization: mu-index is much faster; for example
     in one benchmark, indexing 10000 messages with version 0.1 took ~258
     seconds, with 0.2 it takes ~92 seconds, or about 2.8 times faster
   - tuning options for optimizing performance / memory usage 
   - Maildir++ support (as used by Courier, Dovecot)
   - sorting mu-find results (--sortfields and --sortdir, see mu-find(1)) 
   - added mu-mkmdir tool (mkdir for maildirs)
   - added mu-msginfo tool (get information about email message files)
   - updated documentation (both for developers and end-users)
   - much improved test coverage

** limitations
   - mu-index will ignore html messages without a plain-text part for xapian
     indexing
