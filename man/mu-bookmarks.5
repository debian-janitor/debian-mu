.SH NAME 

bookmarks \- file with bookmarks (shortcuts) for mu

.SH DESCRIPTION

Bookmarks are named shortcuts for search queries. They allow using a
convenient name for oft-used queries.

\fBmu\fR supports bookmarks stored in a file called \fBbookmarks\fR in the
mu home directory (typically, \fI~/.mu/\fR).

The bookmarks file is a typical key=value \fB.ini\fR-file, which is best shown
by means of an example:

.nf
    [mu]
    inbox=maildir:/inbox                  # inbox
    oldhat=maildir:/archive subject:hat   # archived with subject containing 'hat'
.fi

The \fB[mu]\fR group header is required.

For practical uses of bookmarks, see mu-find(1) or mug(1).

.SH LOCATION

The bookmarks file is read from \fI<muhome>/bookmarks\fR. Typically, this
would be \fI~/.mu/bookmarks\fR, but this can be influenced using the
\fB\-\-muhome\fR parameter for mu-find(1) and mug(1).
