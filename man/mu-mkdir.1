.SH NAME 

mu mkdir\-  create a new Maildir 

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B mu mkdir [options] <dir> [<dirs>]

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBmu mkdir\fR is the \fBmu\fR sub-command for creating Maildirs. It does not
depend on the mu database.

With the \fBmkdir\fR command, you can create new Maildirs with permissions
0755. For example,

.nf
   mu mkdir tom dick harry
.fi

will create three Maildirs \fItom\fR, \fIdick\fR and \fIharry\fR.

If the creation somehow fails, for safety reasons, \fBno\fR attempt is made to
remove any parts that were created.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-\-mode\fR=<mode>
set the file access mode for the new maildir as in chmod(1)
