mu comes with a set of unit tests in the tests/ subdirectories of
path,index,msg,find, and a toplevel tests/. We use the g_test framework that
came with GLib 2.16. 

Not all aspects of mu are captured in unit tests yet, but the overall
operation is indeed tested. There are many unit tests of various part, and the
tests in the toplevel tests dir, index a testmaildir, and then search the
results -- this is all works.

running the testcase is as simple as:
  make test
which will run through the cases, and report errors when they fail.

Note, the unit tests create some tempdirs for the results, and the TMPDIR
environment variable will be respected.
