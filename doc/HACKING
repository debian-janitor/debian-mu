** functions are <= 50 lines
** lines are <= 80 characters
** files are <= 1000 lines
** if (bar) {

** non-public functions are static 
** non-static function commented in doxygen style
** public functions check their args with g_return(val_)_if_fail
** functions returning char* must be freed by caller
** otherwise const char* is to be used
** function comments go to the header file
** declarations at the beginning of the block
** don't initialize vars unless needed (so -Wall can warn us)
** code is -Wall -Werror clean on recent gcc
** don't depend on C99
