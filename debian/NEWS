maildir-utils (1.6.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * The database schemata has changed. After upgrading from mu <= 1.6.0 to
    any version >= 1.6.1, mu init (followed by mu index) must be called.

maildir-utils (0.6~beta1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * From this release onward maildir utils does not ship separate programs,
    but only one binary mu that allows for different commands.
    So "mu-index" is not "mu index". Please see that man page of mu
    for details.
